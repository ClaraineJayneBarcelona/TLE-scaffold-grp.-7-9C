			The COVID-19 pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis. Many countries have (rightly) decided to close schools, colleges and universities. The crisis crystallises the dilemma policymakers are facing between closing schools (reducing contact and saving lives) and keeping them open (allowing workers to work and maintaining the economy).
			The severe short-term disruption is felt by many families around the world: home schooling is not only a massive shock to parents productivity, but also to childrens social life and learning. Teaching is moving online, on an untested and unprecedented scale.
			Student assessments are also moving online, with a lot of trial and error and uncertainty for everyone. Many asssments have simply been cancelled. Importantly, these interruptions will not just be a short-term issue, but can also have long-term consequences for the affected cohorts and are likely to increase inequality.
